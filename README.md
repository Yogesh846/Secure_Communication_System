# Secure_Communication_System
- Created a Flask web application that allows users to securely send messages using cryptography and steganography. 
- The system encrypts the message and hides it inside an image to protect the content from unauthorized access during 
  transmission.
- A security-focused application designed to protect digital communication by integrating encryption algorithms with steganography techniques.
- It ensures that the message is not only encrypted but also hidden inside another medium, adding a dual layer of protection.

  **Key Feature**

- Text Encryption & Decryption using standard cryptographic algorithms

- Image-based Steganography to hide encrypted messages

- Dual Layer Security (Encryption + Hiding)

- User-friendly Interface

- Fast, Reliable & Lightweight

- Secure Message Transmission
